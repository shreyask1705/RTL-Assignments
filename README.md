This repository contains all the source codes and testbenches for the RTL assignment. 

Each folder contains 2 folders namely RTL and reports. The rtl folder contains verilog code for the particular module along with the testbench for it. The reports folfer contains compilation reports of the particular
module obtained via Quartus Prime Lite software.

The reports folder contains 7 different reports of different tasks. They are;

1. .asm = assembler
2. .sta = static timing analysis
3. .pow = power consumption of the module
4. .fit = fitter
5. .eda = eda environment test
6. .map = synthesis and analysis
7. .flow = flow summary of the compilation of module.

All reports are based on DE-10 lite FPGA as target FPGA.
